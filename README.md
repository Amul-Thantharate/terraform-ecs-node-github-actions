### AWS ECS Fargate nodejs and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

This is a simple example of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy a nodejs application to AWS ECS Fargate. The pipeline is triggered by a push to the master branch. This application deploys a simple nodejs application that listens on port 3000. The application is deployed to an ECS Fargate cluster. The pipeline uses the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services.

The pipeline consists of the following steps:
1. Checkout the code
2. Install dependencies
3. Login to AWS ECR
4. Build the docker image
5. Push the docker image to AWS ECR
6. Update the Task Definition with the new image
7. Update the Service with the new Task Definition

## Prerequisites
- AWS account
- GitHub account
- Docker
- AWS CLI
- IAM user with the following permissions:
  - AdministratorAccess
- GitHub repository
